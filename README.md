## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v16 or newer)
- [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) or npm

### Quick Start

1.  Clone the repository to your local machine:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/feliperohdee/cloudflare-react-tailwind-client.git my-project
    cd my-project
    ```

2.  Install the project dependencies:

    ```bash
    yarn install
    ```

3.  Start the development server:

    ```bash
    yarn dev
    ```

    This will launch the Vite development server, typically at `http://localhost:3000`, with hot module replacement for real-time updates.

## Available Commands

### Development

- `yarn dev` - Starts the development server.
- `yarn build` - Builds the application for production.
- `yarn preview` - Serves the production build locally for previewing.

### Code Quality

- `yarn lint` - Runs ESLint to analyze code for quality and formatting issues.
- `yarn test` - Executes tests using the Vitest testing framework.

### UI Components

- `yarn add-component [name]` - A command to easily add new shadcn/ui components to your project.

## Adding UI Components

This project utilizes [shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com/) for its component library. You can add new components with a single command. For example, to add a button component, run:

```bash
yarn add-component button
```

This will add the `Button` component and its dependencies to your `app/components/ui` directory. You can find a list of all available components on the shadcn/ui website.

## Deployment

You can deploy the production build of your application to any static hosting provider.

1.  Build your application:

    ```bash
    yarn build
    ```

2.  Deploy the contents of the `dist/` directory to a static hosting service such as:
    - [Vercel](https://vercel.com/)
    - [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/)
    - [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/)
